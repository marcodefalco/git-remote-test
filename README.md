*This is a toy repository I use to get familiar with the Git version control system and how to deal  with remote repositories and pushes*

As a Data Analyst It was time for me to create remote repositories instead of keeping everything local

I used a "website like" project because I wanted to get the best possible grasp on version control systems, therefore dealing with a multiple folders projects, several branches and merges. 

Although this is not critical for all Data Analysts out there, It is very helpful to whomever wants to keep track of all  changes on his data projects.
